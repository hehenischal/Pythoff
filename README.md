# Pythoff
Pyth-off: The Python You Deserve üêç A new evolution in Python programming, delivering innovative features, refined syntax, and enhancements you never knew you needed. Pyth-off sets a new standard for clarity, efficiency, and developer happiness. Because sometimes, you just need to do things differently.

## Adding a New Datatype
We have introduced a new datatype for D&D fans called a 'Unicorn'. It can have a magic value like a potion or spells. 

```python
foo = unicorn('bullets')
```

##  Exponential Explode
Similar to Exponent operator with ' ** ' we have added a Exponential exploding operator with ' *** ' 

```python
a = 6 *** 2 # 6 exponentially exploded by 2
print(a)
```

## Deleting Keywords (debloating language) 
Since, Python was infamous for being too bloated. We are introducing a new and revolutionary keyword called ' delete ' that is used to delete a keyword. 
```python
delete def
```
When you are finally done with debloating the language you can delete the delete keyword to prevent further deletion of the language resulting in Negative time Complexity for algorithms
```python
delete delete
```
## Function Overloading 
Overloading a function was missing in Python, we are introducing the  ` lizzo ` keyword. use this keyword to decorate any function to overload it. 
```
@lizzo
def greet(name):
  print("this is a overloaded function")
```
## Installing RAM 
We at Pyth-off understand that Training AI models and AI girlfriend Chat Bots can hog as much ram as you hog lust. So, we are introducing a feature of installing more ram. By paying just $89.99 every month, you get access 1TB RAM (total) for a Year that resets every year at February 32nd. 

## Simplifying Hello World 
Hello World is the first statement every ex python programmer used to write but Every Pythoff programmer will be writing a faster Hello World program. 
```python
print_Hello("World!")
#prints 'Hello World!' 
```
